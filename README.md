# Future Work
The data collected should include more months so that analysis against the months can be carried out to study the month with the most sales and the products sold the most for each month. Also, the data of the requested orders of each customer should be collected to analyse. The requested order can be analysed against the available order to help the supermarket in serving the customers better. This will reveal the customers' need that are not available.

# Standout Section
I ensured my categorical columns were not just object but they have unique categories. Also, I plotted a violin graph of tax 5% against product line to check for the product which tax is being paid most, and this was discovered Food and beverages, fashion accessories, and home and lifestyle taxes are highest. Members and normal customers patronised equally which showed no effect of the membership which is shown by a bar chart. it was also discovered that there was most patronage during January and February had the least patronage as a bar chat showed it. Also, a graph was plotted to show the product with the highest gross income.

Fashion accessories, home and lifestyle were the product with the highest gross income and electronic accessories had the least. Lagos and Port Harcourt branches had the highest rating.
